# specfuzzer-subject-results

This repository contains the output artifacts generated by **SpecFuzzer** for the set of benchmark subjects used in the paper (subjects from GAssert). It includes all candidate specifications produced by the fuzzer, the filtered invariants detected by Daikon, and the final clustered/ranked assertions.

## Contents

- **`*.assertions`**
  All specifications inferred by **SpecFuzzer** and confirmed as likely invariants by **Daikon**. Each file corresponds to one subject/method and lists every assertion that passed dynamic filtering against the provided test suite.

- **`*-buckets.assertion`**
  Final selected specifications after clustering and ranking. This file contains the strongest, representative assertions for each bucket (group of similar constraints) produced during the mutation-based partitioning step.

- **`*.inv.gz`**
  Compressed archive of all candidate invariants generated by **SpecFuzzer** (before dynamic filtering). Contains the complete set of fuzzed assertions and Daikon templates.

## Usage

1. **Inspect all generated invariants:**
   Decompress the `*.inv.gz` file to review every candidate specification produced by grammar-based fuzzing.

2. **Review dynamic filtering results:**
   Open the `*.assertions` file to see which fuzzed assertions were validated by running the test suite under Daikon.

3. **Examine final, prioritized assertions:**
   The `*-buckets.assertion` file provides the curated set of specifications after removing weak and redundant constraints.
