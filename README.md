# specfuzzer-subject-results

This repository contains the output artifacts generated by [SpecFuzzer](https://github.com/facumolina/specfuzzer) for the benchmark subjects used in the paper (subjects from GAssert). It includes:

- All candidate specifications generated by the fuzzer
- Filtered invariants identified by **Daikon**
- Final clustered and ranked assertions

## Contents

- **`*.assertions`**
  Specifications inferred by **SpecFuzzer** and confirmed as likely invariants by **Daikon**. Each file corresponds to a subject/method and contains assertions that passed dynamic filtering against the test suite.

- **`*-buckets.assertion`**
  Final, selected specifications after clustering and ranking. Each file includes representative, high-confidence assertions from each group (or _bucket_) of similar constraints produced via mutation-based partitioning.

- **`*.inv.gz`**
  Compressed files containing all candidate invariants generated before filtering. Includes raw fuzzed assertions and Daikon templates.

## Usage

To decompress the combined mutants:

```bash
./zmutants/combine-and-extract-mutants.sh
```

This script combines and decompresses the mutant parts (`invs_part_*`) for each subject, generating the full `*.inv.gz` files.
